## Turn your Docs into Video!

This service automatically generates
high quality video presentations from the text scripts!

### Here is how it works:

    1. Create a transcript in Markdown
    2. Break it down to slides using special markup
    3. Add tables, charts, graphics...
    4. Submit the transcript
    5. Get video presentation with a voiceover!
    
### Example

**First,** take a look at this page.
You might have came across it before: it's the first thing to read when one starts working
with React:

<iframe width="620" height="520" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html"></iframe>

**Then** watch this video. It was automatically generated from the page above!

<iframe width="620" height="520" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vlOPzKRUwQs?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
